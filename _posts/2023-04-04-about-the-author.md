## A little bit about myself
Hello, I'm NgocQuan. I'm a sophomore at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. My major is Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My research topic is Natural Language Processing, especially for Vietnamese.
## A little bit about mathematics
My favorite quotes is: "Something wrong ends up to anything you want". It come from a MIT professor who teach the course Fundamental of Statistics. I love anything that symmetric in mathematics. \\
The most beautiful equation in mathematics is $ e^{i \pi} = -1 $, and $ x^n + y^n = z^n $. The former named Euler equation, and the latter is represented for the last Theorem of Fermat.
